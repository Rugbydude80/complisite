-- SAFE RLS FIX DEPLOYMENT - HANDLES EXISTING POLICIES
-- ============================================
-- 
-- This script safely handles existing policies and deploys the RLS fix
-- ============================================

-- STEP 1: DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES (SAFE APPROACH)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their company" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view company users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view org" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project members can view project" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project members can view project members" ON project_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view shared certificates" ON user_certificates;

-- Drop any other existing policies that might conflict
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own company" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company admins can manage company" ON companies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view company users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own user record" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view organizations" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org admins can manage organizations" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view org members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org admins can manage org members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project members can view projects" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project admins can manage projects" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project members can view project members" ON project_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project admins can manage project members" ON project_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own certificates" ON user_certificates;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view shared certificates" ON user_certificates;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Certificate owners can manage shares" ON certificate_shares;

-- STEP 2: CREATE HELPER FUNCTIONS (SAFE - REPLACE IF EXISTS)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_org_admin(user_id UUID, org_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM organization_members 
    WHERE organization_members.user_id = $1 
    AND organization_members.organization_id = $2 
    AND organization_members.role = 'admin' 
    AND organization_members.status = 'active'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_project_admin(user_id UUID, project_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM project_members 
    WHERE project_members.user_id = $1 
    AND project_members.project_id = $2 
    AND project_members.role = 'admin'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_org_member(user_id UUID, org_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM organization_members 
    WHERE organization_members.user_id = $1 
    AND organization_members.organization_id = $2 
    AND organization_members.status = 'active'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_project_member(user_id UUID, project_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM project_members 
    WHERE project_members.user_id = $1 
    AND project_members.project_id = $2
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_company_id(user_id UUID)
RETURNS UUID AS $$
DECLARE
  company_id UUID;
BEGIN
  SELECT u.company_id INTO company_id
  FROM users u
  WHERE u.id = user_id;
  
  RETURN company_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- STEP 3: CREATE FIXED RLS POLICIES (SAFE - CREATE IF NOT EXISTS)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own company" ON companies
FOR SELECT USING (id = get_user_company_id(auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Company admins can manage company" ON companies
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users u
    WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
    AND u.company_id = companies.id
    AND u.role = 'admin'
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view company users" ON users
FOR SELECT USING (company_id = get_user_company_id(auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own user record" ON users
FOR UPDATE USING (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Org members can view organizations" ON organizations
FOR SELECT USING (is_org_member(auth.uid(), id));

CREATE POLICY "Org admins can manage organizations" ON organizations
FOR ALL USING (is_org_admin(auth.uid(), id));

CREATE POLICY "Org members can view org members" ON organization_members
FOR SELECT USING (
  is_org_member(auth.uid(), organization_id)
);

CREATE POLICY "Org admins can manage org members" ON organization_members
FOR ALL USING (is_org_admin(auth.uid(), organization_id));

CREATE POLICY "Project members can view projects" ON projects
FOR SELECT USING (is_project_member(auth.uid(), id));

CREATE POLICY "Project admins can manage projects" ON projects
FOR ALL USING (is_project_admin(auth.uid(), id));

CREATE POLICY "Project members can view project members" ON project_members
FOR SELECT USING (
  is_project_member(auth.uid(), project_id)
);

CREATE POLICY "Project admins can manage project members" ON project_members
FOR ALL USING (is_project_admin(auth.uid(), project_id));

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own certificates" ON user_certificates
FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Org members can view shared certificates" ON user_certificates
FOR SELECT USING (
  user_id = auth.uid() OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM certificate_shares cs
    WHERE cs.certificate_id = user_certificates.id
    AND (
      (cs.shared_with_org_id IS NOT NULL AND is_org_member(auth.uid(), cs.shared_with_org_id)) OR
      (cs.shared_with_project_id IS NOT NULL AND is_project_member(auth.uid(), cs.shared_with_project_id))
    )
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Certificate owners can manage shares" ON certificate_shares
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_certificates uc
    WHERE uc.id = certificate_shares.certificate_id
    AND uc.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- STEP 4: GRANT PERMISSIONS (SAFE - GRANT IF NOT EXISTS)
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION is_org_admin(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION is_project_admin(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION is_org_member(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION is_project_member(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_company_id(UUID) TO authenticated;

-- STEP 5: CREATE PERFORMANCE INDEXES (SAFE - CREATE IF NOT EXISTS)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_organization_members_user_org_role 
ON organization_members(user_id, organization_id, role, status);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_project_members_user_project_role 
ON project_members(user_id, project_id, role);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_company_id 
ON users(company_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_certificate_shares_cert_org 
ON certificate_shares(certificate_id, shared_with_org_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_certificate_shares_cert_project 
ON certificate_shares(certificate_id, shared_with_project_id);

-- STEP 6: VERIFICATION (SAFE - TEST FUNCTIONS)
DO $$
DECLARE
  test_result BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  -- Test is_org_member function
  SELECT is_org_member('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') INTO test_result;

  RAISE NOTICE 'Helper functions are working correctly';
END $$;

-- SUCCESS MESSAGE
