- Audit trail for all actions

## Usage Examples

### Uploading a Certificate
```typescript
const certificate = await CertificateService.createCertificate(userId, {
  certificate_type_id: 'ecs-card-id',
  certificate_number: 'ECS123456',
  issuing_body: 'JIB',
  issue_date: '2024-01-01',
  expiry_date: '2027-01-01',
  file: certificateFile
})
```

### Checking Project Readiness
```typescript
const readiness = await CertificateService.checkProjectReadiness(projectId)
// Returns array of team members with their certificate status
```

### Getting Expiring Certificates
```typescript
const expiring = await CertificateService.getExpiringCertificates(orgId, 30)
// Returns certificates expiring within 30 days
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL commands in `database-production.sql` to create all tables and policies.

### 2. Storage Bucket
Create a `certificates` bucket in Supabase Storage with appropriate RLS policies.

### 3. Dependencies
```bash
npm install react-dropzone date-fns
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Ensure your Supabase configuration is properly set up in your environment.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time certificate validation
- Blockchain-based certificate verification

### Advanced Analytics
- Certificate trend analysis
- Compliance reporting
- Predictive expiry modeling

### Mobile Support
- Mobile certificate scanning

- Push notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### File Upload Failures
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file type (PDF or images only)
- Ensure storage bucket permissions

#### Certificate Verification
- Verify user has admin role in organization
- Check RLS policies are correctly configured
- Ensure certificate is in 'pending_verification' status

#### Expiry Notifications
- Check cron job is running for automatic expiry checks
- Verify notification preferences are enabled
- Ensure email service is configured
