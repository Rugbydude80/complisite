-- ============================================
-- SAFE CORRECTED NUCLEAR RLS FIX
-- ============================================
-- 
-- This script safely removes RLS from problematic tables
-- and creates non-recursive secure views with proper column handling
-- ============================================

-- STEP 1: COMPLETELY DROP ALL POLICIES ON ORGANIZATION TABLES
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view org" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view organizations" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org admins can manage organizations" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view organizations" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view organizations they belong to" ON organizations;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view org members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org admins can manage org members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view org members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view org members of their orgs" ON organization_members;

-- STEP 2: COMPLETELY DISABLE RLS ON ORGANIZATION TABLES
ALTER TABLE organization_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 3: CREATE A MATERIALIZED VIEW TO BREAK THE RECURSION
-- This pre-computes user-organization relationships
-- Using only columns that definitely exist
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS user_org_memberships AS
SELECT 
  om.user_id,
  om.organization_id,
  om.role,
  om.status,
  o.name as organization_name
FROM organization_members om
JOIN organizations o ON o.id = om.organization_id
WHERE om.status = 'active';

-- Create index for performance
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_org_memberships_unique 
ON user_org_memberships(user_id, organization_id);

-- STEP 4: CREATE SIMPLE HELPER FUNCTIONS USING THE MATERIALIZED VIEW
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION user_can_access_organization(check_user_id UUID, org_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_org_memberships
    WHERE user_id = check_user_id
    AND organization_id = org_id
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION user_can_manage_organization(check_user_id UUID, org_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_org_memberships
    WHERE user_id = check_user_id
    AND organization_id = org_id
    AND role = 'admin'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- STEP 5: CREATE SECURE VIEWS USING THE MATERIALIZED VIEW (NO RECURSION)
-- Only select columns that definitely exist
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW secure_organizations AS
SELECT 
  o.id,
  o.name,
  o.created_at
FROM organizations o
WHERE user_can_access_organization(auth.uid(), o.id);

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW secure_organization_members AS
SELECT 
  om.id,
  om.organization_id,
  om.user_id,
  om.role,
  om.status,
  om.joined_at
FROM organization_members om
WHERE user_can_access_organization(auth.uid(), om.organization_id);

-- STEP 6: GRANT PERMISSIONS
GRANT SELECT ON user_org_memberships TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON secure_organizations TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON secure_organization_members TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION user_can_access_organization(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION user_can_manage_organization(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;

-- STEP 7: CREATE FUNCTION TO REFRESH THE MATERIALIZED VIEW
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_user_org_memberships()
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW user_org_memberships;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION refresh_user_org_memberships() TO authenticated;

-- STEP 8: REFRESH THE MATERIALIZED VIEW
SELECT refresh_user_org_memberships();

-- STEP 9: TEST THE NEW APPROACH
DO $$
DECLARE
  test_result INTEGER;
  test_bool BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  -- Test materialized view
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_result FROM user_org_memberships LIMIT 1;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ user_org_memberships materialized view working (% rows)', test_result;
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå user_org_memberships materialized view failed: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
  
  -- Test helper functions
  BEGIN
    SELECT user_can_access_organization('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') INTO test_bool;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ user_can_access_organization function working';
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå user_can_access_organization function failed: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
  
  -- Test secure views
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_result FROM secure_organizations LIMIT 1;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ secure_organizations view working';
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå secure_organizations view failed: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
  
  BEGIN

    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ secure_organization_members view working';
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå secure_organization_members view failed: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
END $$;

-- STEP 10: IF DESCRIPTION COLUMN EXISTS, CREATE ENHANCED VIEW
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if description column exists
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'organizations' 
    AND column_name = 'description'
  ) THEN
    -- Create enhanced view with description
    EXECUTE '
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW secure_organizations_enhanced AS
    SELECT 
      o.id,
      o.name,
      o.description,
      o.created_at
    FROM organizations o
    WHERE user_can_access_organization(auth.uid(), o.id)';
    
    GRANT SELECT ON secure_organizations_enhanced TO authenticated;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Enhanced view with description created';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE '‚ö†Ô∏è  Description column not found, using basic view only';
