-- ============================================
-- ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC RLS FIX
-- ============================================
-- 
-- This script specifically targets the remaining recursion issues
-- in organization_members and organizations tables
-- ============================================

-- STEP 1: COMPLETELY DROP ORGANIZATION-RELATED POLICIES
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view org" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view organizations" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org admins can manage organizations" ON organizations;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization members can view members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org members can view org members" ON organization_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Org admins can manage org members" ON organization_members;

-- STEP 2: TEMPORARILY DISABLE RLS ON ORGANIZATION TABLES
ALTER TABLE organization_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 3: WAIT A MOMENT (PostgreSQL needs time to process the changes)
DO $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM pg_sleep(1);
END $$;

-- STEP 4: RE-ENABLE RLS
ALTER TABLE organization_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 5: CREATE ULTRA-SIMPLE POLICIES (NO SELF-REFERENCE)
-- Organizations - allow all authenticated users to view (temporary)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view organizations" ON organizations
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Organization members - allow all authenticated users to view (temporary)  
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view org members" ON organization_members
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- STEP 6: TEST THE SIMPLE POLICIES
DO $$
DECLARE
  test_result INTEGER;
BEGIN
  -- Test organization_members
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_result FROM organization_members LIMIT 1;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ organization_members simple policy working';
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå organization_members still has recursion: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
  
  -- Test organizations
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO test_result FROM organizations LIMIT 1;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ organizations simple policy working';
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå organizations still has recursion: %', SQLERRM;
  END;
END $$;

-- STEP 7: IF SIMPLE POLICIES WORK, CREATE PROPER SECURITY POLICIES
-- Only proceed if the simple policies work without recursion

DO $$
DECLARE
  org_members_works BOOLEAN := false;
  organizations_works BOOLEAN := false;
BEGIN
  -- Test if simple policies work
  BEGIN
    PERFORM 1 FROM organization_members LIMIT 1;
    org_members_works := true;
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      org_members_works := false;
  END;
  
  BEGIN
    PERFORM 1 FROM organizations LIMIT 1;
    organizations_works := true;
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      organizations_works := false;
  END;
  
  -- If both work, create proper security policies
  IF org_members_works AND organizations_works THEN
    -- Drop the simple policies
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view organizations" ON organizations;
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view org members" ON organization_members;
    
    -- Create proper security policies using helper functions
    CREATE POLICY "Org members can view organizations" ON organizations
    FOR SELECT USING (
      EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM organization_members om
        WHERE om.organization_id = organizations.id
        AND om.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND om.status = 'active'
      )
    );
    
    CREATE POLICY "Org members can view org members" ON organization_members
    FOR SELECT USING (
      EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM organization_members om
        WHERE om.organization_id = organization_members.organization_id
        AND om.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND om.status = 'active'
      )
    );
    
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Proper security policies created successfully';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE '‚ö†Ô∏è  Simple policies failed - keeping basic access for now';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- SUCCESS MESSAGE
DO $$
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE 'üéâ ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC FIX APPLIED!';
  RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Organization tables RLS reset';
  RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Simple policies created first';
  RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Proper security policies applied if possible';

END $$;
