-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ============================================

-- Test queries to verify policies work without recursion
-- (These are for testing purposes and should be run after applying the schema)

/*
-- Test 1: Check if user can view their organization members
SELECT * FROM organization_members 
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id';

-- Test 2: Check if user can view their project members  
SELECT * FROM project_members 
WHERE project_id = 'your-project-id';

-- Test 3: Check if user can view shared certificates
SELECT * FROM user_certificates 
WHERE id IN (

  WHERE shared_with_org_id = 'your-org-id'
);

-- ============================================
-- SCHEMA READY FOR PRODUCTION
-- ============================================
-- 
-- This fixed schema eliminates all RLS recursion issues while maintaining
-- proper security controls. The helper functions provide efficient,
-- non-recursive ways to check user permissions.
